# Simulation of galactic sources

This project aims to assess the contribution of unresolved point sources to the diffuse pi0 emission as measured by Fermi-LAT. (Part of https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04554 and my thesis)

The magic happens in simulation.py

The notebook (sim_UPS.ipynb) incorporates the diffuse emission and calculates things such as fractions and makes all the plots

Files needed: point source catalog (3FGL, 3FHL); spectrum of diffuse emission at ROI
